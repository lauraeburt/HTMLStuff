<p> My name is Laura Burt. I am a Certified teacher and an honors graduate from Appalachian State University and Marygrove College.
    I have teaching experiences in grades six through nine (as well as Math I and Algebra I) in both urban and suburban school districts.
    Currently, and for most of my career, I have been teaching in Title I schools.  I have worked closely with a local university in
    North Carolina to develop rich, meaningful unit plans designed around the Common Core.
    As a veteran teacher certified in Mathematics, I have learned various instructional strategies (i.e Math Recovery and Intel Mathematics)
    that enhance learning in the classroom, especially through the use of technology, discovery, and meaning-making.
    I have assumed many leadership roles in the districts in which I have taught.
    Data disaggregation is something that I am particularly good at, which makes me a very diagnostic and prescriptive teacher.
    I have been rated as a highly effective teacher for all three years that I have taught in Michigan, and I ranked highly effective every year in North Carolina.
    I love technology and I love to continue to learn ways that I can improve my craft.  </p>

<p> During my teaching in Brethren, I was fortunate enough to write and receive a grant that allowed our district to participate
    in the First Robotics program.  It was there that I fell in love with coding.  It was a delight to work with my students to try to solve coding
    issues without any coding background.  Together, we learned to research and probem solve in order to make our robot run!
    It was that experience that let me see..I could do this for my livelyhood.  Now, the second chapter (well maybe like the fifth)
    of my life is beginiing.  </p>

<p>   As much as I love to code, I have an opposite side that loves the outdoors!  My hobbies include hunting, fishing, riding
      motorcycles, and hiking with my dog. </p>
